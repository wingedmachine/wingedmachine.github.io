### an introduction

I've never finished Douglas Hofstaedter's *Gödel, Escher, Bach*. I can see from the state of the pages exactly how far I've ever made it. The minor damage of repeated handling of the pages abruptly gives way to a flawless stack of untouched paper. But I've started reading it countless times since my dad gave it to me when I was a kid, and it takes a special kind of book to stick with you that long while you repeatedly fail to get to the end of it. It's lodged firmly in my brain. 

Or maybe there's just always been a nook in my brain that was perfectly shaped for it to fit into. I remember sitting as at my grandparents' kitchen table with pencil and paper working through one of the symbolic logic questions the book poses as my grandmother washed dishes and occassionally looked with bewilderment at the strange symbols I was puzzling over.

Programming—at it's grandest, when it isn't hunting down the causes of syntax errors or trying to figure out why user input to a website isn't being recieved by the back end even though all the sode that should handle that is *right there*—fits into that same nook. It can be building vast intricate machines with nothing but my brain. And if I have to occassionally spend a day examining every inch of the machine to find the place where a missing screw is causing the machine to malfunction, well, that hunt has its own charms. 

So that's the answer to why I got into why I got into software development. I didn't. It got into me a long time ago.

I think tonight I'll take *GEB* off the shelf again, and give it another try.
