### T - O - underscore - P - R - O - C
I didn't have opportunity to use it during my most recent project, but I'm going to talk about a neat Ruby thing I learned about outside of class. The ampersand colon. As in:

```
books.each(&:title)
```

Despite how it appears, the ampersand and colon aren't combining into a single operator here. They're doing two different side-by-side jobs that combine to get the desired effect. 

First, though, let's look again at that code example I listed above. In lessons to date, that same effect would always be achieved by writing:

```
books.each { |book| book.title }
```

This is our starting point. The section in braces there is a "block," and a block can be wrapped in an object called a [Proc](https://ruby-doc.com/core/Proc.html), which gives us methods like #call. When an ampersand prefixes a Proc as the last parameter of a method call, the method threats that Proc as a block, so we can rewrite that previous line of code as:

```
get_title = Proc.new { |x| x.title }
books.each(&get_title)
```

This is where the colon comes in. It does what we've seen a colon do many, many times. It makes a [Symbol](https://ruby-doc.com/core/Symbol.html), and symbols all have #to_proc, which returns a Proc that performs the method with the same name as the symbol. So our previous code can instead be:

```
get_title = :title.to_proc
books.each(&get_title)
```

The last step is easy. If you put an ampersand before something that is not already a Proc, Ruby will automatically call #to_proc on it in a bit of implicit casting, so now we're back to the line of code I showed at the very beginning:

```
books.each(&:title)
```

Magic!
